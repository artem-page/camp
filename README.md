In this GitHub project, you can discover the following things:

1. **Implementation of a timestamp microservice project engineered with NodeJS and ExpressJS:**

    * In response to an empty request (/api/timestamp-microservice), expeditious disclosure of the current date and time ensues, presented in both Unix and UTC formats.

    * Should an inquiry involve an invalid date (/api/timestamp-microservice/eqibcrbc), the microservice provides a resolute response in the form of "Invalid Date."

    * When a date is requested in a human-readable format (/api/timestamp-microservice/2015-12-25), the microservice exhibits adept handling of the input, delivering the specified date in the aforementioned formats.

    * Analogous outcomes are achieved when querying with a numerical value (/api/timestamp-microservice/1451001600000).

    * At the time of documenting this content, the microservice demonstrated operational efficacy at the URL https://camp.r1a1.xyz:8043/api/timestamp-microservice

2. **Implementation of a request-header-parser microservice project engineered with NodeJS and ExpressJS:**

    * In response to GET request (/api/request-header-parser/whoami) the server returns your ip address, language and software.

    * At the time of documenting this content, the microservice demonstrated operational efficacy at the URL https://camp.r1a1.xyz:8043/api/request-header-parser/whoami
