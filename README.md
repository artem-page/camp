Considering that the majority of my work projects are stored in private GitLab and GitHub repositories, I have chosen to establish several public repositories to showcase my proficiency in fundamental programming concepts. The GitHub repository named **/camp** will be specifically dedicated to completing challenges from the FreeCodeCamp website.

In this GitHub project, you can discover the following things:

1. **Implementation of a Timestamp Microservice engineered with NodeJS and ExpressJS:**

    * In response to an empty request (/api/timestamp-microservice), expeditious disclosure of the current date and time ensues, presented in both Unix and UTC formats.

    * Should an inquiry involve an invalid date (/api/timestamp-microservice/eqibcrbc), the microservice provides a resolute response in the form of "Invalid Date."

    * When a date is requested in a human-readable format (/api/timestamp-microservice/2015-12-25), the microservice exhibits adept handling of the input, delivering the specified date in the aforementioned formats.

    * Analogous outcomes are achieved when querying with a numerical value (/api/timestamp-microservice/1451001600000).

    * At the time of documenting this content, the microservice demonstrated operational efficacy at the URL https://camp.r1a1.xyz:8043/api/timestamp-microservice

2. **Implementation of a Request Header Parser Microservice engineered with NodeJS and ExpressJS:**

    * In response to GET request (/api/request-header-parser/whoami) the server returns your ip address, language and software.

    * At the time of documenting this content, the microservice demonstrated operational efficacy at the URL https://camp.r1a1.xyz:8043/api/request-header-parser/whoami

3. **Implementation of a URL Shortener Microservice engineered with NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB:**

    * This project implements a URL Shortener Microservice, providing functionality to shorten long URLs and redirect users to the original ones. It is built using Node.js and Express, leveraging a MongoDB database to store URL entries. The microservice also includes middleware to handle invalid URLs, ensuring that only valid and well-formed URLs are processed.

    * A middleware function (validateUrl) is implemented to ensure that only valid URLs are processed. It checks the format of the provided URL using a regular expression (urlPattern) and verifies its syntactic correctness using the URL class. If the URL is invalid, an error response with a message "invalid url" is sent.

    * The microservice exposes a POST endpoint (/api/shorturl) where users can submit a URL to be shortened. The endpoint first checks if the URL is already in the database. If not, a new entry is created, and the original and short URLs are returned in the response.

    * A GET endpoint (/api/shorturl/:short_url) is provided to redirect users to the original URL associated with a short URL. If the short URL is found in the database, the user is redirected. Otherwise, an error response is sent.

    * MongoDB is used as the database to store URL entries. The Url model is used to interact with the database and perform operations such as finding existing entries or creating new ones.

    * At the time of documenting this content, the microservice demonstrated operational efficacy at the URL https://camp.r1a1.xyz:8043/api/shorturl/44

    * All links shortened in this example: https://camp.r1a1.xyz:8043/api/collections/urls

4. **Implementation of an Exercise Tracker Microservice engineered with NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB:**

    * The Exercise Tracker project provides a RESTful API for tracking user exercises. It allows users to create accounts, add exercises, and retrieve their exercise logs.

    * Users can create a new account by making a POST request to /api/users. The request should include a username in the form data. The response will contain an object with properties username and _id.

    * Users can retrieve a list of all users by making a GET request to /api/users. The response will be an array of user objects, each containing username and _id properties.

    * Users can add exercises by making a POST request to /api/users/:_id/exercises. The request should include the user's ID (_id), exercise description, duration, and an optional date. The response will contain details about the added exercise, including username, description, duration, date, and _id.

    * Users can retrieve their full exercise log by making a GET request to /api/users/:_id/logs. The request can include optional parameters from, to, and limit to filter and limit the log entries. The response will include a user object with properties username, _id, count (number of exercises), and log (an array of exercise details). Each exercise entry in the log contains description, duration, and date properties. The date is formatted using the dateString format of the Date API.

    * The project includes two functions for formatting dates: formatDateString: Formats a date string submitted by the user or uses the current date if the input is empty or invalid. convertUTCToYYYYMMDD: Converts an ISO 8601 format date string to 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, using the current date if the input is empty or invalid.

    * At the time of documenting this content, the microservice demonstrated operational efficacy at the URL https://camp.r1a1.xyz:8043/api/users/65831c90042c6c50242d4f77/exercises and https://camp.r1a1.xyz:8043/api/users/65831c90042c6c50242d4f77/logs

    * All exercises in this example: https://camp.r1a1.xyz:8043/api/collections/exercises
